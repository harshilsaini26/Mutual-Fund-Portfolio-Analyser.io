## Coverage

| | |
|---|---|
| Schemes in the AMFI universe | 19,676 |
| Schemes with a loaded portfolio | **200** |
| **ISINs a look-through can answer for** | **1,144** |
| Holding rows | 11,166 |
| AMC formats with a parser | 5 — HDFC, ICICI, Kotak, Nippon, PPFAS |
| **AMCs that fetch themselves** | **2** — Kotak, ICICI |
| **Schemes reachable without one** | **1,973**, via the coverage tier |
| **Funds on the public site** | **1,661** — every open fund with a Direct plan and a year of prices |
| Funds with an expense ratio | 1,790 of 1,864 open Direct funds (AMFI, August 2026) |
| Groww portfolios in the public build | 92 after the first night; ~1,600 over sixteen |

The gap between 200 schemes and 1,144 ISINs is V1-37: a disclosure describes a
*scheme*, and every share class of that scheme — Direct, Regular, Growth, each
IDCW variant — holds the identical portfolio. Which share classes make one fund
comes from AMFI's own scheme master since 2026-09-23 (V1-68), refreshed by
`jobs.fetch_nav`; the name-trimming rule it replaced split older funds, and 49
share classes had no portfolio they were owed. Until the same day a HELD share
class was never served its fund's disclosure at all -- only the lookup was --
so a holder of HDFC Flexi Cap Regular saw 100% `__NO_DISCLOSURE__`.
`rebuild_weights` now keys every share class itself, so the API and the terminal
report cannot disagree about it, and each is served its fund's **newest** usable
disclosure rather than an older one filed under its own ISIN.

The master's fund names also sharpened which sheet of a workbook is which
fund (V1-69). Nine Kotak sheets the matcher had refused now identify —
Gilt, three SDL index funds, Banking and Financial Services, Gold Fund,
Gold ETF and the Multi Asset Omni fund-of-funds — and one wrong match is
gone: that fund-of-funds sheet had been filed as Kotak Infrastructure and
Economic Reform, whose own sheet spells the name with an "and" the old
key had lost. One fund is filed twice by hand, ICICI Multi Asset under its
Direct and Regular ISINs, so the 200 schemes are 199 funds.

The master also carries each fund's launch date, now on 18,162 schemes and on
the fund page. It needs no command: `jobs.fetch_nav` fetches it after the day's
prices, and a failed fetch leaves the prices loaded and marks the run
`partial`.

**Fund analytics:**

| | |
|---|---|
| Schemes with a benchmark index | **1,819** — 129 indices, from fund names and from disclosures |
| Benchmark indices with a total-return series | 93, 348,174 daily levels from 2011 |
| **Schemes with alpha, beta, tracking error and capture** | **1,220**, 163 of them active funds |
| Risk-free rate | every 91-day T-bill auction, 2011-04-06 to 2026-04-08 (772) |

**All three reference funds are covered:**

| | rows | unresolved |
|---|---|---|
| HDFC Flexi Cap | 83 | **0.00%** |
| Kotak Pioneer | 55 | **0.00%** |
| ICICI Multi Asset | 290 | **0.00%** |

PPFAS Flexi Cap, the fifth fund with a disclosure, is also at **0.00%**.

Disclosure quality across all 200: **173 `ok`, 27 `warn`, 0 quarantined.** The
warnings are V3 on 13 (unresolved value above 2%), V2 on 13 (a portfolio a
quarter's growth away from AMFI's quarterly average AUM, V1-67), and four
others. A fund whose net current assets are below zero -- owing more than it is
owed on the day -- no longer warns; the fund page says so in words instead
(V1-71). No parse is being stored that disagrees with the file it came from.

Unresolved across the whole warehouse is **0.52%** of value, measured over each
scheme's newest disclosure. It was 2.12% before state development loans had an
issuer.

## How to add a fund

**Two tiers, and which one you get depends on the fund house.**

### The coverage tier — any fund, one command

```bash
python -m jobs.fetch_groww --slug <groww-slug> --dry-run   # check first
python -m jobs.fetch_groww --slug <groww-slug>
```

Groww's scheme page is server-rendered and carries the whole portfolio, so this
reaches any of 1,973 funds with no download and no browser. Find the slug in
`https://groww.in/mf-sitemap.xml` — **it is not derivable from the fund's name**,
because Groww keeps whatever the fund was called before it was renamed.

Where an AMC parser already covers a scheme, its workbook stays the source of
record: `m3_lookthrough.weights.latest_disclosure` prefers it over a newer page
while it is inside the 45-day staleness threshold, so the coverage tier fills
gaps rather than displacing better data (V1-46).

It pays for that reach with the ISIN column, which the page does not have:
**8.96% of HDFC Flexi Cap unresolved against 0.00% from the AMC's own file**,
and 22.63% of PPFAS, which holds foreign equity and certificates of deposit that
only an ISIN resolves. Every such disclosure is stamped `source_tier =
'aggregator'`, and a scheme the AMC tier already covers is skipped rather than
downgraded.

### The AMC tier — the five houses with a parser

```bash
# 1. find your fund house in config/amc_disclosure_index.yaml (all 52 are there)
# 2. download its monthly portfolio workbook
# 3. drop it in data/inbox/ and:
python -m jobs.ingest_inbox
```

It works out which house published the file, which scheme each sheet describes,
and loads all of them. 88 schemes from one Kotak workbook, 91 from one Nippon,
about 70 seconds each. A sheet it cannot identify with certainty is reported and
skipped, never guessed at.

**Kotak and ICICI no longer need the download.** V1-03 said discovery needed a
browser since every AMC page is JavaScript-rendered; that was the wrong
conclusion — a JS front-end implies a JSON backend, and the backend is neither
authenticated nor challenged:

```bash
python -m jobs.fetch_amc --amc kotak --list        # what is published, fetch nothing
python -m jobs.fetch_amc --amc kotak --period 2026-08 --kind fortnightly
python -m jobs.ingest_inbox
```

That is the whole loop, with no hand-download and no CAPTCHA — Kotak's own
workbook, whose website dropdown answers a portfolio request with a Radware
challenge this project will not solve (V1-32). The CAPTCHA guards the page, not
the data. **21 schemes loaded from a file nobody touched.**

Those listings are also archives, which the coverage tier is not: Kotak's runs
to **April 2013**, 70 monthly disclosures, so a fund loaded this way can be
backfilled. ICICI publishes one 25 MB ZIP of ~146 workbooks, and
`jobs.ingest_inbox` now expands a ZIP into its workbooks itself — flattened,
guarded against a member path escaping the inbox, never overwriting a file
already there. That path is tested but has not yet been run against a live
ICICI file.

The other 50 AMCs are one adapter each. The house you hold is the one worth
writing, and everything else has the coverage tier above.

## Keeping the units check honest

```bash
python -m jobs.fetch_aum --list --years 4    # what AMFI has published
python -m jobs.fetch_aum                     # load the newest two quarters (V1-90)
python -m jobs.fetch_aum --quarter 2026-03-31
```

§10's V2 reconciles a disclosure's summed market value against an AUM from
**outside the file being checked**, and quarantines when they disagree — it is
what catches a 100x unit error. It had never run: `scheme_aum` did not exist.

AMFI's scheme-wise average AUM fills it, joined on `AMFI_Code` with no name
matching, **12,388 rows** covering 99.5% of the schemes that have a disclosure.
It is a quarterly average rather than a month-end balance, so it sits a few
percent from a portfolio through ordinary market movement; `basis` travels with
the figure and V2 widens its tolerance to match. A 100x error still fails it by
11,321%.

## Starting it

```bash
python start.py
```

One command from a fresh clone (DECISIONS V1-72): a private environment, the pinned
dependencies, market data from its public sources, and the portal open in the browser.
The first run takes a few minutes plus about 70 for NSE's index history and resumes if
interrupted; later starts refresh today's prices in seconds. A new user with no CAS
imported still gets every fund page -- the server starts on an empty ledger rather than
refusing. The README walks through the rest in order: looking up a fund, importing a
statement, loading more funds' holdings, and keeping it current.

**The portal was redesigned on 2026-09-24** (DECISIONS V1-74): a sidebar and a top bar
with search, dark and light themes, KPI tiles, tables that sort, and a home page that is
a setup checklist until a statement is imported and a dashboard of the three landing
questions after. Two defects kept that dashboard from ever appearing and are fixed: an
import now computes and stores the look-through itself (it used to take a separate
terminal script), and a portfolio page with no date asks for the newest stored
look-through rather than today's. A third was found beside them: a figure labelled
"5 years" over four years of prices; a fixed window is now shown only when the prices
span it.

**A public copy of the fund pages** -- 754 funds -- builds with
`python -m jobs.publish_site` and publishes to `gh-pages` with `--push`. It carries
AMFI's prices and fund houses' own disclosures only: NSE's index levels are licensed for
personal use, so benchmark comparisons stay in the self-hosted app, and the build never
opens a personal ledger. Publishing is only ever the user's own command. Its front
page lists every published fund in one table, sortable by size and by 1-, 3- and 5-year
return and narrowed by category, with no fund singled out.

## Looking up any fund

```bash
python start.py     # then search for a fund by name at the top of any page
```

Every fund in AMFI's list has a page, `/fund/<ISIN>`, found by typing any words
of its name (DECISIONS V1-70). It is pictures first, each with one plain
sentence above it:

- **the fund at a glance**: its name, house, category and plan, a strip of figures
  (returns over 1, 3 and 5 years beside the benchmark's, each with a sparkline; the worst
  fall and its recovery; volatility; size), and how steady it has been;
- **what Rs 10,000 became**, against the benchmark with dividends, over 1, 3 or
  5 years or everything on record; the period tabs redraw that chart alone;
- **returns by period**, fund beside benchmark;
- **falls and recoveries**, how far below its last high it stood each day;
- **consistency**, the return of every three-year stretch;
- **what it owns**, as an asset-mix ring, a holdings treemap and bars by size
  and sector, for the 200 schemes with a portfolio loaded.

The charts are interactive (hover, zoom, series toggles) and the figures in them
are formatted on the server: a tooltip says exactly what the CSV export says.
The table of every statistic stays at the bottom, closed.

Two more panels since 2026-09-25 (DECISIONS V1-76 to V1-78): **its peers**
(a sentence, the category's three-year risk against return with this fund
marked, and its rank on six measures) and **its expense ratio**, AMFI's total
TER, in the header beside a "Category rank, 3 years" tile.

In the local app a fund's pictures need its price history, loaded for the funds
you hold; `python -m jobs.backfill_scheme_nav --universe --missing` loads every
open fund's (about an hour). The public site has all of them: see below.

## The public site

<https://didmysipwork.vercel.app/>, built every night by GitHub Actions from the APIs alone
(DECISIONS V1-75): `.github/workflows/site.yml` runs `jobs.build_site` on a fresh
machine and pushes one commit to `gh-pages`, which Vercel serves from the root of its
address (V1-92; GitHub Pages served it until 2026-10-03). Measured on the first full build, 2026-09-26:

- **1,864 open funds with a Direct plan**; 1,661 have a year of prices and a page.
- **History**: the first build fetches every fund from mfapi.in (~1 hour at the
  polite 0.5 requests a second); the site then carries a compact copy
  (`data/nav/`) so later builds fetch only what is new. Four funds have no
  usable history: three Franklin segregated portfolios priced 0 every day, and
  one AMFI-coded fund likewise; one fund priced 0 on a single day has no
  figures and is reported by name.
- **Peers**: 95 AMFI category names become 64 groups (`config/categories.yaml`);
  7,393 period figures computed once per build.
- **Expense ratios**: last month's AMFI workbook, 3,539 fund-plans joined to
  12,357 share classes.
- **Holdings**: Kotak's and ICICI's own files, workbooks in `inbox/`, and
  Groww's pages (V1-79), 100 a night, each panel marked as from an aggregator.
- **Pages ~90 KB** (from 352 KB): each panel's figures are a linked CSV, not an
  inline table (§10.4).
- **Benchmarks, by proxy** (V1-81): NSE's levels stay out, so a fund is compared with
  an index fund that declares the same benchmark on its Groww page, named as such.
  The crawl map gained that column on 2026-09-26, so proxies fill in as pages are
  read, about 100 a night.
- **Explanations on hover** (V1-91): pausing on any labelled figure with a glossary
  entry, or tabbing to its `?`, opens its plain explanation beside it; a click pins it.
  The fund card's confidence badge no longer covers the NAV box.
- **Fund sizes, every quarter** (V1-90): AMFI publishes a quarter's fund sizes as fund
  houses report, so the newest file can name only a few houses for weeks. The size job
  now loads the newest two quarters; each fund keeps its newest figure.
- **Landing page** (V1-89): the front page is a scroll-told story. The hero shows a
  real example fund opening into what it holds, with three equal ways in (look up a
  fund, understand funds, see your portfolio), then one section per way in, a plain
  privacy section, and where the data comes from. Motion is CSS only and builds marks,
  never words; the leader tables moved to /funds/; the React islands are retired.
- **UX fixes and polish** (V1-88): measured against an audit (375/768/1440px, three
  themes, a 320–1600px sweep) and Apple's design principles. The top bar folds into a Menu
  on tablets, every text colour passes 4.5:1, fields have a 3:1 outline and a focus ring,
  a skip link, an eight-size type scale with prose in Atkinson, no animated figures,
  Explore funds' filters in the address, and 40px tap targets on phones.
- **Learn** (V1-87): 26 terms and 11 guides, each written for this site and
  linked to the SEBI, AMFI or Zerodha Varsity pages it was checked against, with
  the date. A `?` beside a term on the fund, `/funds/`, compare and portfolio pages
  opens its explanation in place; `/learn/` has the guides and an A to Z glossary.
  The build refuses a source off the allowed list, advice-style wording, or any
  tax figure.
- **Compare** (V1-85): `/compare/` sets two to four funds side by side, chosen from
  a "Compare" link on each fund page or a picker, the choice kept in the address:
  key figures with the highest and lowest of each marked, what ₹10,000 became in
  each from the first date all have prices, how much of their portfolios is the same
  companies, and their asset mix and sectors. Worked out in the browser from files
  the site already publishes.
- **Fund pages, navigable** (V1-84): a pinned row of section links marks where you
  are; on a phone the page is about 9 screens instead of 12, with nothing scrolling
  sideways and secondary detail one tap away.
- **Settings** (V1-83): theme, font, text size, density, motion and accent from a
  panel in the top bar, applied before the first paint and live.
- **Your portfolio** (V1-82): pick funds, enter lump sums and SIPs; value, XIRR,
  look-through and the same money in up to three other funds of each category, all
  worked out in the browser and pinned to the ledger's arithmetic by
  `tests/fixtures/portfolio_cases.json`.

## Benchmarks

```bash
python -m jobs.fetch_index --catalogue      # NSE's 259 indices, rarely changes
python -m jobs.fetch_index --resolve        # index funds and ETFs, from their names
python -m jobs.fetch_index --declared       # active funds, from their own disclosures
python -m jobs.fetch_index --held           # total-return levels for every one in use
python -m scripts.show_fund_xray --scheme INF179K01UT0
```

The same figures are on the fund page, `/fund/<ISIN>`, linked from every
scheme in Holdings. The page and the script both call M2's
`fund_windows`, so they cannot disagree; checked against HDFC Flexi Cap, they
match to the digit (5y alpha 8.42%, beta 0.85).

A benchmark comparison needs two things: which index a fund is measured
against, and that index's total-return series. The first comes from a fund's
name where the name carries it and from the fund's own monthly disclosure where
it does not; where both answer, they have agreed on every one of 275 share
classes. The second comes from NSE, one request per index per year, and a
refresh fetches only what it does not already have.

Only total-return series are used. A price index leaves out dividends, so a
fund compared against one looks better than it is by roughly the index's
dividend yield — about 1.3% a year on the Nifty 50.

## What is stale

```bash
python -m jobs.status            # offline, instant
python -m jobs.status --check    # also ask the AMCs that can be asked
```

Per fund house: how many schemes are behind, by how many months, and the exact
command that would fix it — `jobs.fetch_amc` where a discovery adapter exists,
the AMC's own page where one does not. SEBI allows ten days after the month end,
so nothing is called late before then.

The unit is the **scheme**, not the house. Kotak's August file carried 21 of its
96 schemes, and a report keyed on the house's newest disclosure called that
"current" — an error that grows more confident the larger the fund house is.

## Modules

| | |
|---|---|
| **M0 data** | built — fetch, parse, resolve, validate, load |
| **M1 ledger** | built — CAS parsing, FIFO lots, XIRR/TWRR, reconciliation |
| **M3 look-through** | built — exposure, overlap, concentration, duplication, nested funds, marginal contribution |
| **M6 views** | built — fifteen views (eight portfolio, seven on the fund page) in a sidebar-and-dashboard layout with dark and light themes, interactive charts, fund search, sortable tables, CSV export, loopback API |
| M2 fund x-ray | partly built — return windows, risk statistics, rolling returns, Sharpe and Sortino, and alpha, beta, tracking error and capture against a total-return index |
| M4 risk | specified, not built |
| M5 market | specified, not built |
| Tax engine | not built; rates live in a human-verified config and are never invented |

M2 was rebuilt on 2026-09-16 as two files and no SQL, reading NAV through the
`MarketDataProvider` that already existed. Its risk-free rate (S13) and its
index series (S12) have since landed, so the benchmark- and rate-dependent
statistics compute wherever that data reaches — the S13 and S12 entries under
the defects below say how far that is. The rest of its spec — the three-window
model, peer ranks, the manager dossier, turnover — is blocked on data rather
than effort.

M4 and M5 still have no code. All three previously had a package each —
Protocols plus a fake per protocol, 2,416 lines — whose only importers were the
two tests that checked each contract against its own fake. They were deleted on
2026-09-16. Their
specifications are unchanged, kept with the other specs outside the public
repository, which is where an unbuilt module belongs: a Protocol with one
implementation, and that implementation a test double, is a placeholder with a
type annotation, and it cost a compile, a typecheck and a lint on every commit
to keep.

A repository-wide audit on 2026-09-24 removed what was left of the same kind,
4,061 lines in all (V1-73): contract types for M2, M4 and M5 that nothing
constructed, M3's data-provider Protocol, M1's handoff to M2, the fakes behind
them, and M0's integrity gate and review queue, which no job ever called.
Queries only the tests asked moved from `src/` to `tests/helpers.py`, and `pypdf`
went: `pdfplumber` decrypts a statement on its own.

## What is not true yet

- **Nobody has used this.** Including its author. Every figure carries its own
  as-of date, staleness and coverage precisely so you can judge how far to trust
  it, and the answer for now is "not with money that matters".
- **47 of 52 AMCs have no disclosure of their own loaded.** The public site
  fills the gap from Groww's pages, which carry no ISINs, so more of each is
  unresolved; the first pass over them takes about sixteen nights.
- **Peer ranks leave out closed funds.** Nothing records a fund wound up or
  merged, so the ranks compare survivors only, and every peer panel says so.
- **The local app's peer panels are empty** unless every open fund's history is
  loaded (`backfill_scheme_nav --universe --missing`, then the figures); the
  public site is where peers live.
- **Two of the eleven specified views are absent**, deliberately — sector
  tilt and the holdings treemap need M5's sector taxonomy and company data,
  and a view that always renders empty is a broken feature pretending to be a
  data problem. The fund page, marginal contribution and the size profile
  landed on 2026-09-23.
- **The local server trusts anything on this machine.** It answers only to
  `127.0.0.1` and `localhost` (the 2026-09-23 security audit closed DNS
  rebinding), but it has no login: while `jobs.serve` runs, any process or
  Windows account on the machine can read the decrypted portfolio. Accepted for
  a single-user PC; a per-launch token is the fix if the machine is shared.
- **Nothing runs end to end against a real ledger in CI.** Zone B needs a key,
  and the golden-file verifier covers the arithmetic instead.
- **Statement decryption changed on 2026-09-24 and has not met a real statement
  since.** `pdfplumber` now decrypts on its own; two synthetic protected PDFs,
  RC4 and AES-256, test the right and the wrong password, but no real CAS has
  been imported through it yet.
- **The first start blocks for about 70 minutes.** The portal opens only after
  the last setup step, NSE's index history, although every fund page works
  without it.
- **No chart of the portfolio's value over time.** The dashboard answers where you
  stand today; a "growth of your money" line needs a daily valuation, and M1 keeps
  one `as_of`. It is not approximated.

## Known defects, measured and unfixed

Ordered by what they cost.

0. ~~**A unit re-denomination read as a 900% gain.**~~ **Closed 2026-09-18.**
   55 schemes carried a 10:1 or 100:1 split, clustered on three dates. Nothing
   divided it out, so ICICI Prudential Overnight Fund — a fund that cannot
   move 1% in a day — reported 14.8x over seven years, and every volatility,
   drawdown and Sharpe built on those series was garbage.

   `rescale_splits` brings a series onto one scale before anything reads it,
   restricted to the ratios AMCs actually use. ICICI Overnight now reports
   **5.18%/yr against Kotak Overnight's 5.16%** — two funds that were never
   supposed to disagree. Discontinuities in `nav_adj` went **56 to 1**.

   The one left is `INF174KA1DB4`, which drops 10.0727 to 0.0001 in a single
   row. That is a clean power of ten and is NOT a split; it is a dying fund's
   last row, and it stays visible as the defect it is.

0. **`scheme_idcw` is empty; most IDCW returns are now derived instead.**
   9,187 of 19,598 schemes are `idcw_payout` or `idcw_reinvest` and the table
   holds **0 rows**. `build_nav_adj` writes `nav_adj = nav` when a scheme has no
   events, so the column is fully populated and identical to raw NAV — a
   total-return series in name only. Any return computed from it is short by the
   whole distributed amount; for a daily-IDCW plan that is the entire return,
   which is how a liquid fund reports 0.00%.

   **Largely solved 2026-09-18, with no fetcher.** A Growth option and an IDCW
   option of one plan hold ONE portfolio at one TER, so the Growth series is
   already a record of what the IDCW plan earned. `build_nav_adj` derives from
   it when no declarations exist: `nav_adj(t) = nav(anchor) * G(t)/G(anchor)`.
   Verified on Kotak Liquid Daily-IDCW, whose full-series return went from
   **4.97% on raw NAV to 64.81% adjusted**.

   The sibling is the **same plan's** Growth option since 2026-09-23. Until
   then any Growth option of the fund would do, and 4,548 IDCW plans were
   derived from the other plan's series, off by the gap between the two plans'
   expense ratios. 202 still are: their own plan has no Growth option, and the
   other plan's series is nearer the truth than raw NAV, which misses every
   payout.

   Scope, stated honestly. 4,468 of the 4,595 IDCW schemes with NAV have such
   a sibling, but only **604** have more than one NAV row of their own — the
   rest are a single point, where no return exists to correct. Of those 604,
   **522** now carry a real total-return series. The remainder follow
   automatically as NAV history backfills; the derivation is already in place.
   A real **S14** is still what the 127 schemes with no Growth sibling need.

   Of the three that bounded M2, all three now produce numbers — one of them
   only partly:

   - **S14** IDCW — solved without a fetcher, from the Growth sibling. Above.
   - **S13** risk-free rate — **closed.** `rbi.org.in` answers an automated
     client with HTTP 418, and nothing here defeats a bot check; but RBI's
     statistics portal, `dbie.rbihub.in`, serves the same auction table to an
     ordinary request. `config/risk_free.yaml` holds all **772** 91-day T-bill
     auction yields from 2011-04-06 to 2026-04-08 — every auction, because a
     quarterly sample is out by up to 4.50 percentage points at a window
     start: the cut-off went from 7.24% to 12.02% inside Q3 2013. Sharpe and
     Sortino compute for any window starting on or after 2011-04-06.
   - **S12** index levels (TRI) — **closed for everything NSE publishes.**
     `benchmark_id` is set on **1,819** of 19,598 schemes (1,389 with NAV),
     pointing at 129 indices, and **93 of those have a total-return series
     loaded** — 348,174 levels from 2011. Alpha, beta, tracking error and
     capture compute today for **1,220 schemes, 163 of them active funds.**

     The mapping comes two ways. `--resolve` reads an index out of a fund's
     name, which reaches index funds and ETFs. `--declared` reads the
     benchmark an active fund's own disclosure states — Kotak, Nippon, HDFC
     and PPFAS all print one — which reaches funds whose names do not carry
     it. Where both gave an answer, on 275 share classes, they agreed every
     time.

     Two funds show the result has the right shape. ICICI Prudential Nifty 50
     Index Fund Direct, over 1, 3 and 5 years: beta 1.00, tracking error
     0.03–0.05%, alpha −0.23% to −0.29% — the index minus a fee, which is the
     only shape an index fund's alpha can take. HDFC Flexi Cap against the
     NIFTY 500 TRI its disclosure names: beta 0.80–0.86, tracking error around
     4–5%, and alpha of 5.70% over 3 years and 8.42% over 5 — an active fund
     that has earned its fee.

     Three ceilings are not effort problems. NSE publishes no total-return
     series for its G-Sec, SDL or arbitrage indices — 36 of the 129. Over
     half of all schemes are debt funds, benchmarked mostly to CRISIL
     indices, which are not published free. And declared benchmarks exist
     only for the five fund houses with a disclosure loaded.

     One limitation is a modelling choice rather than a gap. A scheme has one
     current benchmark, and a 5-year alpha is measured against it for the
     whole window. SEBI moved many benchmarks in 2021, so for a fund that
     changed, the pre-2021 part of a long window is compared against an
     index it was not then measured against.

0. ~~**For 54 of NSE's 259 indices, the catalogue and the level series mint
   different ids.**~~ **Closed 2026-09-23.** `index_id_for` keeps a trailing
   "Index" that `index_key` strips, so a level series whose name left the word
   off minted a second id that no scheme pointed at. The catalogue now mints an
   id once, and a level series attaches to the registered row by key; a key
   matching two rows raises. It never fired: every benchmarked index with such
   a name is a debt index, and NSE publishes no TRI for those. Only a manual
   `--backfill` of one could have reached it.

0. **`rebuild_weights` commits, so it cannot compose into a caller's
   transaction.** A job that loaded holdings and then rebuilt weights would
   have its partial work committed by a library it called.
   `m3_lookthrough/persist.py` is the module that owns M3's other commits.
0. **The rebuild re-reads the 9,143 rows it just wrote.** `materialise_weights`
   holds the weights and classes and discards them; `load_issuer_weights` then
   issues 192 queries for the same data — 24ms of a 195ms rebuild. Returning
   them is a behaviour change: a scheme whose holdings vanish currently keeps
   surfacing its stale rows, because `materialise_weights` returns 0 without
   deleting.

0. ~~**Most debt holdings are classed as `equity`.**~~ **Closed 2026-09-23.**
   18.0% of all equity-classed weight sat on bond, CP and CD ISINs, so every
   equity-scoped figure (concentration, `overlap_equity_pct`, marginal HHI, the
   size profile) counted debt as equity. Two causes in the shared reader: debt
   headings it did not know (`Certificate of Deposit`, `Commercial Paper`,
   `Non Convertible Debentures`) fell back to equity, and Kotak's listing-status
   heading (`Listed/Awaiting listing…`) replaced the instrument heading above it
   and read as equity. Fixed at parse time (reader 5), plus one precedence rule:
   a row whose own name resolved to cash is cash under a borrowed heading.
   All 204 AMC disclosures re-derived as new revisions: 2,759 rows moved
   (2,491 to debt, 178 to cash), no equity share (`INE…01`) left equity, and
   the debt share of equity weight fell to 0.22% — Kotak's REITs, which Kotak
   itself files under equity. The aggregator page re-derives on its next fetch.
0. **`scheme_aum` retracts by DELETE, because it has no revision.** V1-54 scoped the
   delete to one quarter, but invariant 2 forbids even an `UPDATE` of a fact row and
   this table deletes them. The fix is `revision`/`is_current` as every other fact
   table has, which moves the primary key and touches `aum_for`, the
   `INSERT OR REPLACE` and the restatement counter. A slice, not a patch.

1. ~~**State development loans have no issuer.**~~ **Closed 2026-09-24.** A
   state loan's ISIN carries its government's two-digit code, and each loan
   now resolves to that state's government ("Government of Maharashtra"), a
   real borrower apart from sovereign paper (§8.4). The code table carries its
   evidence for every entry -- a fund house naming the state, or a public
   listing whose coupon matches our own holdings -- and a disclosure naming a
   different state refuses the code (V1-71). 633 of 639 rows resolve, to 19
   states; codes 36 and 37 have no evidence yet and their 6 rows stay
   unresolved. Three Kotak SDL index funds went from 58-97% unresolved to 0%.
2. ~~**Covered calls classify as `equity`.**~~ **Closed 2026-09-24.** ICICI
   prints its written calls inside the equity block, each named `(Covered
   call)`. The name already resolved to `__DERIV__`; the heading made the
   class equity, so V8 warned. A row whose name resolves to a derivative is
   now one under any heading (reader 7): 43 rows moved, and ICICI Multi
   Asset reads `ok`. Nothing else in the warehouse changed class.
3. ~~**`checks.py:96` claims V3 blocks the look-through. Nothing does.**~~
   **Closed 2026-09-23.** A quarantine now blocks, as MODULE_3 §5.4 specifies:
   `latest_disclosure` never picks a quarantined disclosure, so a scheme uses
   its last one that passed or, with none, shows as `__NO_DISCLOSURE__` with a
   caveat naming it (V1-66). A warning — V3 among them — does not block, and
   the comment now says so.
4. ~~**A fund inside a fund is not looked through.**~~ **Closed 2026-09-18.**
   §6's recursion is built: a `__MFUNIT__` holding expands into the issuers of
   the fund it names, depth-capped at 2 and cycle-guarded. The opaque bucket
   went from 6.15% of an illustrative portfolio to 1.84%, closure unchanged.
   What remains bucketed is honest: 17 of the 53 funds held as units have no
   disclosure of their own, and a unit staged without an ISIN (the aggregator
   tier) has nothing to resolve against.
5. ~~**204 disclosures predate the AUM witness.**~~ **Closed 2026-09-23.** The
   reader-5 re-derive gave every AMC disclosure a new revision, and V2 ran on
   all of them. 17 fail it — 13 Kotak, 4 Nippon, 25% to 640% off AMFI's
   quarterly-average AUM — and none is an error: each is growth, a fund that
   existed for part of the averaged quarter, or a witness covering one plan of a
   fund AMFI lists per plan. V2 against an average now quarantines only a
   mismatch of 10x or more, the size of a units error, and warns below that
   (V1-67); all 17 are `warn`, and all 192 disclosed schemes have weights.
6. **Four latent defects in the fetch and status layers.** `extra_headers` can
   override the User-Agent the robots check used; the retry loop replays POSTs;
   `jobs/status.py:standings` picks a parser from an unordered set when a house
   has two; `_index`'s cache outlives a config change. None is reachable today
   (V1-48).
7. **`data_only=True` returns None for a workbook Excel never cached.** Would
   reproduce V1-36's silent row-drop. Not observed; worth a loud check when a
   file of that shape appears.
8. ~~**Three latent defects in S12's benchmark path.**~~ **Closed 2026-09-23.**
   Index levels are now refused when not positive, as NAVs are. A window with
   too little overlap keeps its `benchmark_id`, so "not enough data" no longer
   reads as "no benchmark". And a year that returns no levels is marked parsed
   rather than left `pending` — as is the index catalogue, a path the first
   fix missed and the warehouse, checked afterwards, showed up.
9. ~~**Every re-run of the S12 backfill re-archives what it already has.**~~
   **Closed 2026-09-23.** NSE stamps each response with a per-request
   `RequestNumber`, so the same year hashes differently on every fetch and
   §3.1's content-addressed archive never recognised a repeat: one full re-run
   stored 1,369 duplicate files, 47 MB. A run now skips every year before an
   index's latest loaded one — those were fetched after they ended — and
   re-fetches only that latest year, which may be partial, and anything later.
   Checked live: Nifty 50 went from 16 requests to 1, and the archive grew by
   one file of new data. `--full` still re-fetches everything, to pick up a
   restated level.

   A refresh of all 129 benchmarked indices now costs about 724 requests
   instead of 2,064. This entry used to estimate 250, and that was wrong: 576
   of the 724 go to the 36 indices NSE publishes no series for, which look
   unfetched every time because nothing records "asked, got nothing". They add
   nothing to the archive — an empty answer deduplicates — so what is left is
   requests, not duplication. Removing it needs that record, which is a schema
   change.

## Next

The coverage machinery is done; the work now is making it usable by someone
who has never heard of a look-through.

**Waiting on the owner:** add the `MF_CONTACT_EMAIL` repository variable
(Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables) and run the **site**
workflow once by hand; the nightly schedule takes over from there.

Phase 2 (every fund, its peers and its cost, built nightly) is done. In order:

- **UX, part 3a — finding**: search everywhere, richer `/funds/` filters, `/funds/`
  laid out for phones, and ticks there to add funds to a comparison. Comparing (3b)
  is done (V1-85).
- **Your portfolio, next**: redemptions and switches, IDCW plans, what a
  Regular plan cost you in rupees, and the local app's nine portfolio views
  gathered into two pages. Building a portfolio in the browser is done
  (V1-82).

Then the data work already planned:

- **The small internal defects above**: `rebuild_weights` committing, the
  re-read, the four latent fetch defects and a loud `data_only` check.
- **Two schema changes**: `scheme_aum` revisions, and remembering which
  indices have no series, so a refresh stops asking NSE for them — 576 of its
  724 requests.
- **More discovery adapters**, one per house, as funds are actually held.
  Each also brings that house's declared benchmarks: run
  `python -m jobs.fetch_index --declared` after loading its disclosures.
- **Run ICICI's ZIP end to end** — the expansion is built and tested, never
  run against a live file.
- **The tax engine, M4 risk and M5 market.**

Two gaps have no free source and are deferred rather than planned: IDCW
history for the 127 schemes with no Growth sibling (only each fund house or
CAMS publishes it, scheme by scheme), and CRISIL's debt indices, which are
licensed.

## Reading this repository

`docs/CLAUDE.md` has the ten invariants everything else defers to, and
`docs/ledger.md` and `docs/lookthrough.md` the extra rules for the two modules
that carry the correctness gates. The module specifications, the build plan and
the decision log are kept out of the public repository; the reasoning behind a
change travels in its commit message instead, which is why those run long —
including the ones that record a mistake and its correction.
