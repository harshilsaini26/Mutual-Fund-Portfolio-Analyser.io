"""The view registry. MODULE_6.md §4.1 and §5.3.

`VIEW_DEFS` is the catalogue; `VIEW_REGISTRY` is the set of builders that exist.
**A startup check asserts the two match exactly**, both ways: a definition with
no builder is a screen that cannot render, a builder with no definition is code
nothing routes to. §5.3 calls a mismatch a deployment error.

**`question` is a required field**, a forcing-function rather than
documentation: §2.3 says *"if the question can't be stated in a sentence, the
view shouldn't exist"*, and a view without one cannot be constructed.

**Only the views that can be built are here** — nine of §8.1's eleven. The
other two need M5's sector taxonomy and company data, and are ABSENT
rather than registered with a stub returning empty: an absent view is an
honest gap the consistency check enforces, where a registered one that always
returns `empty` is a broken feature pretending to be a data problem.
