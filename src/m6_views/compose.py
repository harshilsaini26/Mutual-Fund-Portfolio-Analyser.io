"""Building an `ok` envelope. MODULE_6.md §3 and §5.2.

Every builder ends the same way: take the portfolio's quality figures, assemble
the caveats, stamp the provenance, wrap the payload. Doing that in six places
would give six chances to forget `unresolved_pct`, and a provenance field that is
missing from one view is exactly the quiet erosion §2.2 makes the fields
non-defaultable to prevent.

It lives outside `builders/` on purpose: §19.3's static check walks every file
under `builders/` looking for arithmetic on provider-sourced values, and a shared
helper there would either trip it or force the check to grow an exception. There
is no arithmetic here either — it is assignment and string assembly — but keeping
the check's scope exactly "the view code" is worth more than the convenience.
