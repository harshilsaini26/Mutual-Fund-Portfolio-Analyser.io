"""Number, percentage and date formatting. MODULE_6.md §9.

Indian grouping is **last three digits, then pairs**: 1234567.89 becomes
12,34,567.89, not 1,234,567.89.

**`None` renders as an em dash** — never `0`, never blank, never `N/A` (§9.3).
The distinction is load-bearing: a NULL means nobody computed it, a zero means
somebody did and the answer was nothing. Rendering a NULL XIRR as 0.0% would be
a lie with a number on it.

Formatting is the one thing M6 does to a figure (§2.1 forbids deriving one), and
it lives here rather than in a builder so there is exactly one place to check.
