"""The HTTP API. MODULE_6.md §15.

**Loopback only, no auth** (§15.3). Single user, bound to 127.0.0.1. Adding
authentication before any non-loopback binding is its own decision requiring its
own review, not something to bolt on when the bind address changes.

**A builder that raises must not take down the screen.** `PLAN.md` §4.9 is
"degrade one panel, never the screen", so the route returns an `error` envelope
with the exception's class and message — never a 500, never a stack trace.

**Connections are opened with `check_same_thread=False` and every use takes
`DB_LOCK`.** The first reasoning was that `async def` routes run on the event
loop's single thread and so satisfy the default check. They do not: the loop
runs in whatever thread started it, never the one that opened the database. The
first API test failed with a `ProgrammingError` swallowed into an `error`
envelope — which is how a wrong assumption hides when the error path is
well-behaved.

So the opt-out is explicit at the call site and the safety it removes is put
back with a lock. sqlite3's check exists because concurrent use corrupts cursor
state, and serialising every request restores that without pretending the
threading model is simpler than it is.
