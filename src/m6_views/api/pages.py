"""The HTML surface. MODULE_6.md §16.

Server-rendered Jinja over the same envelopes `/api/views/{view_id}` returns.
There is no second data path: the page and the JSON come from one `build_view`
call each, so a chart cannot show a figure the API disagrees with.

**Every chart renders inside `view_container`** (§16.3). The spec enforces that
with an ESLint rule over React components; here the macro is the only thing that
opens a `section.view`, and `tests/unit/test_m6_render.py` asserts the property
on the rendered HTML — every `[data-chart]` element must be a descendant of a
`section.view`. Testing the output rather than the source means the rule survives
a refactor that moves the templates around.

Two things are mostly absent. **Drill-down** (§12.2) has four targets, and
one exists: Holdings links each scheme to `fund_xray_header`, scoped by
`scope_id`. `company_page`, `sector_detail` and `overlap_detail` wait on data
not loaded yet. The per-view URLs are here so every view is linkable and
bookmarkable (§12.1: "costs nothing at the start and is painful to retrofit");
links into screens that do not exist are not.
**Display preferences** (§4.3's `user_display_pref`) are not built either; the
defaults are §9's.
