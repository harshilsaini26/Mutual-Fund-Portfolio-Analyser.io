"""`fund_portfolio`: "What does this fund own?". MODULE_6.md §8.1, one fund.

Four pictures of one disclosure: the asset mix as a ring, the companies as
tiles sized by weight, the equity by the sector the fund house printed, and the
equity by AMFI size bucket. The sums are M3's (`composition`); this lays them
out, folds the smallest tiles into one counted "others" tile (§11.2), and keeps
`__UNRESOLVED__` visible however small (Appendix A).
