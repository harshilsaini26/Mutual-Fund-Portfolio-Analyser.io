"""`fund_consistency`: "Was the return steady, or a few good years?".

MODULE_6.md §8.2's `rolling_distribution`, drawn as a line a reader can follow:
the return of every three-year stretch (one year where the history is shorter),
by the day it ended, beside the benchmark's for the same stretch. MODULE_2.md
§4.1: a single point-to-point return is an artefact of two dates; the spread
of all of them is the honest version.
