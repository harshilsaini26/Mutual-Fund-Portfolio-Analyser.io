"""`fund_peers`: "How does it compare with funds that do the same job?".

DECISIONS V1-77. Where a fund's figures sit among the live funds of its
canonical category (`m2_fund.peers`): a sentence, a picture of the category's
risk against its return with this fund marked, and its rank on each measure.
Every figure was computed and ranked in M2; this file only words and arranges
them (§2.1). Descriptive throughout (§2.6): a rank says where a fund stood over
a period, not where it will stand.
