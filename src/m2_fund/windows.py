"""Return windows. MODULE_2.md §8.1.

§8.1 computes eighteen fields; eight of them need a benchmark or a risk-free
rate. The risk-free side is on record: `config/risk_free.yaml` carries every
91-day Treasury Bill auction since 2011 (S13), so Sharpe, Sortino and the
downside deviation that feeds Sortino are all computed here, with the rate that
produced them travelling beside as `risk_free_pct`.

The benchmark side is now on record too, for part of the warehouse. S12 loads
NSE's total-return series and resolves 1,573 of 19,598 schemes to an index, so
alpha, beta, tracking error, information ratio and the capture ratios are
computed where a fund has a benchmark and left `None` where it does not. That
is optionality of the ordinary kind, and it is why these fields exist at all
now — a field that is ALWAYS `None` claims to be optional when it is in fact
unavailable, which is what they were before an index series existed.

Two different `None`s remain, and they mean different things. Sharpe is `None`
for a window starting before 2011 because the risk-free record does not reach
it. Beta is `None` for an active fund because nothing says which index it is
measured against — its name does not carry one, and the disclosure that does is
not loaded for every AMC.

The three-window model of §3 — fund, manager, user — is not here either. There
is no manager or tenure data, and W_user needs the Zone B ledger. What remains
is the fund window. The longest is `since_first_nav`, not `since_inception`:
the launch date is known now (AMFI's scheme master, S2), but the NAV history
held can start after it, and the window is only as long as the prices are.
