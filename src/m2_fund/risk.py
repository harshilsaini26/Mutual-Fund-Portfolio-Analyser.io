"""Return and risk arithmetic over a NAV series. MODULE_2.md §8.

Pure functions: every one takes a series and returns a number. No SQL, no
connection, no I/O — M2 reads through `MarketDataProvider` (invariant 3), and
everything here operates on what that hands back.

**The series must be adjusted NAV.** Raw NAV of an IDCW plan drops on every
payout, so a return computed on it reads a distribution as a loss
(`MODULE_0.md` §9.1). `nav_series` defaults to `adjusted=True`; nothing here
re-checks it, because the column is chosen one layer up and checking twice
invites the two checks to disagree.

Callers hand over a validated series: `compute_return_window` rejects a
non-positive NAV once, before any of this runs.

Every figure is a `Decimal` (invariant 1).
