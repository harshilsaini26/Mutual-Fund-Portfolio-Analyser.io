"""A fund among the funds that do the same job. DECISIONS V1-77; MODULE_2 §11.

**Peers** are the live funds (`m0_data.universe`) in the same canonical category
(`config/categories.yaml`, V1-76) -- which already makes them Direct plan only,
as §11.2 rule 1 requires, and one share class per fund. For a window, only the
funds whose prices span it are ranked: four years of history is not a five-year
record, whatever the window is called.

**Ranks** use the figures `m2_fund.stats` stored for every fund, so a page reads
its category once instead of every peer's history. The spec's rules, and where
they were silent or wrong:
- each metric has a direction (§11.2 rule 4). Worst fall is stored as a negative
  depth, so the smaller fall is the *higher* number; the spec's `lower_better`
  would rank the deepest fall first. The expense ratio (V1-78) ranks the
  cheapest first, and is read from `scheme_ter` rather than the stored windows.
- ties share a rank, 1, 2, 2, 4 (the spec gave no tie rule);
- fewer than `MIN_PEERS` ranked funds is no rank at all, with the reason (the spec
  set no minimum);
- every rank carries how many were ranked of how many are in the category
  (§11.2 rule 3);
- wound-up funds are not included -- nothing records them yet -- so §11.2 rule 2
  (survivorship) is unmet, and each page says so.
