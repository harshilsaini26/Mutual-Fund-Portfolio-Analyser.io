"""The series behind the fund page's pictures. MODULE_2.md §8.3 and §9.

`windows.py` reduces a price history to a few numbers per window. A chart needs
the path those numbers summarise: what Rs 10,000 became along the way, how far
below its last high the fund stood on each day, and what every rolling three
years returned. They are computed here, not in the view layer (MODULE_6.md
§2.1): M6 downsamples and labels them, and draws nothing it did not receive.
