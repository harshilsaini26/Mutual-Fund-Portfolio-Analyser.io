"""Fuzzy name matching. MODULE_0.md §8.2 step 3, on the standard library.

§8.2 specifies `token_set_ratio` with thresholds of 92 to auto-accept and 80 to
review. The algorithm is reimplemented here on the standard library and the
thresholds are kept; what calibration did not support is using that score alone.

**`token_set_ratio` scores 100.0 on genuinely different companies**, so no
threshold makes it safe on its own:

    tech mahindra                  ~ mahindra mahindra      100.0
    tata motors passenger vehicles ~ tata motors            100.0

That is the algorithm working as designed: when one name's tokens are a SUBSET
of the other's, the intersection IS the shorter name, so "is contained in" and
"is equal to" are indistinguishable. On a 400-name sample, 18 would have been
auto-accepted onto the wrong issuer at 95 — including Tech Mahindra onto
Mahindra & Mahindra.

The fix is a second condition rather than a higher bar: the token sets must also
be close, by Jaccard overlap. At `jaccard >= 0.7` the same sample produced ZERO
wrong auto-accepts from 90 to 95, so §8.2's 92 stands — the number was never the
problem (V1-02).

Where either condition fails the row stays unresolved, flagged for review: a
guess wearing a confidence score is worse than an unresolved row a human can
fix (V0-21).
