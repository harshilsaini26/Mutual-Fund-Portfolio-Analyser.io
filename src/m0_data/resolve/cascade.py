"""The resolution cascade. MODULE_0.md §8.2.

Executed in order, first hit wins: known ISIN, synthetic rule, provisional ISIN,
alias table, fuzzy name, then unresolved and flagged for review. §8.1 is why any
of it exists — the exposure unit is the **issuer**, so every disclosed row must
end up pointing at one.

Four departures from §8.2, all recorded in DECISIONS V1-02 and V1-29:

1. **A KNOWN ISIN beats a name rule.** §8.2 runs the synthetic rules at step 0.
   Against the real AMFI universe that captures seven listed companies —
   `Future Retail Ltd.` and five more — because §8.4's derivative pattern
   matches the bare word `future`, bucketing real equity as `__DERIV__`. An
   ISIN resolving to a known instrument is harder evidence than a word in a
   name. TREPS, cash and receivables carry no ISIN, so they still reach the
   rules at step 1.
2. **Fuzzy acceptance needs a second condition.** `token_set_ratio >= 92` alone
   scores 100 for a name that merely CONTAINS another (`tech mahindra` against
   `mahindra mahindra`). See `fuzzy.py`.
3. **A valid but unknown ISIN does not create a provisional issuer silently.**
   The row is queued, so a human sees a new issuer appear.
4. **An ISIN's issuer segment is tried before it is called unknown.** Without
   it §8.1's premise held only for equity: on ICICI Multi-Asset, HDFC Bank
   resolved once and unresolved five times — 1,939 Cr of one company's paper in
   `__UNRESOLVED__` while its equity resolved cleanly (V1-29).

Nothing here returns None. Invariant 4: an unresolvable row resolves to
`__UNRESOLVED__` and stays visible.

#: already-loaded row differently, and compared by `next_revision` so the next
#: load re-resolves rather than reporting `skipped=1` over stale issuers.

#: **The entity master is an input, and the version covers it.** V1-41 lets
#: disclosures name issuers the market-cap list never had, so the same cascade
#: over a larger master gives different answers — growing the master is a bump.
#: What is NOT automatic is noticing that it grew.
#:
#: Rows written before the ISIN issuer segment existed carry `'0'` from the
#: migration default, which is what makes the first run after an upgrade rewrite.
#: 10: a tie at the top no longer hides the exact name (audit, 2026-10-04).

#: How many leading characters of an Indian ISIN identify the ISSUER rather
#: than the security. `IN` is the country, the next five are the entity, and
#: characters 8-9 are the security type — so `INE040A` is HDFC Bank whether what
#: follows is equity, an AT1 bond or a certificate of deposit.
#:
#: Measured before this was relied on: 5,427 instruments produce 5,425 distinct
#: segments, and the two that collide are share-class pairs the master had
#: already split into two issuers. A colliding segment is never resolved.
