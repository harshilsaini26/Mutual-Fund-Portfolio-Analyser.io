"""Fetch layer. MODULE_0.md §5, with §2.3's scraping hygiene.

Everything that touches the network lives here, so the parser below it is a
pure function on text and every test in this module runs offline.

The one rule that is not a preference: **write the file to disk before
inserting the manifest row** (§5.2). A `raw_file` row pointing at a file that
does not exist is unrecoverable — the bytes are gone and nothing can re-derive
them. An orphan file on disk is harmless and a reconcile job finds it.
