"""Canonical fund categories: which of AMFI's category names are the same thing.

DECISIONS V1-76. AMFI is part-way through renaming its categories, so one SEBI
category can appear under two headings ("Equity Scheme - Flexi Cap Fund",
"Equity Schemes - Flexi Cap Fund") and a peer group built on the raw string
would split it. `config/categories.yaml` records which names are merged and
why, and which are kept apart because merging them would be a judgement.

A name the file does not list is not guessed at: it becomes a group of its own,
named as AMFI writes it, placed in a family by the start of the name, and
flagged `mapped=False` so a page can say so.
