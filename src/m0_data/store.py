"""The build's store: every live fund's prices, compact, carried inside the site.

DECISIONS V1-75. The daily build runs in a fresh machine each time, with no
warehouse and no archive. What it keeps between runs is this: one small file per
fund, published with the site under `data/nav/`, read back by the next build so
that only today's prices (and any fund still short) need fetching.

    data/nav/118955.csv.gz
      # scheme_id=INF179K01UT0 amfi_code=118955
      2013-01-01,100.000000
      ...

Named by AMFI code, which every scheme has; a scheme listed without an ISIN is
keyed `AMFI:<code>:...`, no file name on Windows. Published prices only -- an
interpolated row is the build's own and is rebuilt, not kept.

**A cache, not a source of record.** AMFI's daily file and mfapi remain the
sources; a file that fails any check here is refused whole, and the build fetches
that fund again. Written deterministically (gzip with no timestamp), so a fund
whose prices did not change writes the same bytes.

**When each fund was last fetched from mfapi** (`data/nav/fetched.csv`, a URL
and a date per fund) is carried too: without it every build would ask again for
the ~200 funds whose history mfapi itself starts late or ends early.

**The aggregator's holdings** (DECISIONS V1-79) are the other thing a build
cannot fetch again in full each day: Groww's pages are read at most 100 a day.
`data/holdings/` carries each current aggregator disclosure, its rows, and the
`raw_file` rows they cite -- URL, date and SHA-256, not the page -- one gzipped
CSV per table, restored as they were written. A file whose columns are not the
table's today is refused and those pages are read again as the crawl reaches them.
