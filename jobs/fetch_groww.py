"""Load a scheme's portfolio from its Groww page. DECISIONS V1-43.

    python -m jobs.fetch_groww                      # every slug in the map
    python -m jobs.fetch_groww --scheme INF179K01UT0
    python -m jobs.fetch_groww --slug <slug> --dry-run
    python -m jobs.fetch_groww --crawl 100 --map data/groww.csv   # the daily build

**The crawl** (DECISIONS V1-79) is how the public build covers every fund Groww
lists without a hand-kept map: its sitemap names ~1,600 Direct Growth pages, and
each page states its own ISIN. A CSV map (`--map`) remembers what each page said
and when it was read. Each run reads at most `--crawl` pages -- pages due a
monthly refresh first, then pages never read, then pages that named no fund we
list, again after three months -- so the first pass takes about sixteen days at
100 a day, and after it the refresh needs about fifty a day.

**The coverage tier.** `load_holdings` reads an AMC's own workbook and covers
the five houses with a parser; this reads an aggregator's page and covers any
fund Groww lists. NOT a replacement where a workbook exists — the page carries
no ISIN column, costing 8.96% of rows unresolved against 0.00%.

**The slug is the whole risk, so it is checked twice.** A slug cannot be built
from a scheme name: Groww keeps the pre-rename name, so HDFC Flexi Cap lives at
`hdfc-equity-fund-direct-growth`. A wrong slug that 404s is harmless; one that
RESOLVES would load a real portfolio under the wrong `scheme_id` with nothing
downstream able to tell. So the page's own `isin` is compared against the one
the map promised, and a mismatch REFUSES.
