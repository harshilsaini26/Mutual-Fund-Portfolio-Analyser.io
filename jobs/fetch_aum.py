"""Load AMFI's scheme-wise average AUM. S3, DECISIONS V1-49.

This is what §10's V2 needs: V2 reconciles a disclosure's summed market value
against `scheme_aum`, and without the table it never ran on a single disclosure.

**The scheme is the sum of its plans.** AMFI publishes one row per share class,
so HDFC Flexi Cap's Direct-Growth plan reports Rs 34,740 Cr against a Rs 113,606
Cr portfolio. A disclosure describes the SCHEME (V1-37), so the figure stored is
its family's total, written against EVERY member — `aum_for` is asked about
whichever ISIN a disclosure happened to be loaded against.

A scheme with no `scheme_family` gets its own plan's figure and nothing else: it
under-reports rather than guessing at a grouping never shown coherent, and an
under-reported AUM makes V2 stricter rather than blinder.
