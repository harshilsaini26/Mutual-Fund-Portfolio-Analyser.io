"""AMFI's scheme-wise AAUM, and the check it finally lets run. V1-49.

`tests/fixtures/m0/amfi_aaum_2026Q1.json` is the real response for
`April - June 2026`, trimmed from 8,545 share classes to the 16 belonging to
the four funds this project actually holds. Every retained row is verbatim;
nothing was edited to make a number work.

**What §10's V2 is for, and what it could not do.** V2 reconciles a
disclosure's summed market value against `scheme_aum` and QUARANTINES on
failure, because §7.2's 100x unit error fails it by two orders of magnitude.
`scheme_aum` did not exist, so V2 had never run on a single disclosure here —
0 of 205 carried an `aum_reported`. These tests exist to stop it going back.
