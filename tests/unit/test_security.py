"""Security regressions. Written before the fixes.

Every case here was **demonstrated against the running code** before it was
written down, not inferred from a pattern. Two of them share a source: issuer
names come from AMC disclosure files fetched over the internet, so a hostile or
compromised disclosure is remote input that reaches a local page and a local
spreadsheet.

That framing was too narrow. The AMC's LISTING is the same trust boundary as
its content, and the filename in it reaches a filesystem write -- a worse sink
than either. See the download case below.

`src/m1_ledger/` is test-first by `CLAUDE.md`, which covers the ledger file-mode
case below.
