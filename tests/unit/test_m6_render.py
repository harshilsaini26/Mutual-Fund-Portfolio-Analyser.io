"""The rendered page. MODULE_6.md §16 and §19.7.

**This file is what closes the V1 acceptance gate.** The criterion is *"every
chart renders its as-of date, staleness, and coverage"*, and every other test in
this project asserts on a Python object or a JSON body. Here the assertions are
on HTML that a browser would show.

The load-bearing test is `test_no_chart_renders_outside_a_view_container`. §16.3
calls the wrapper the mechanism that makes the honesty commitments structural
rather than per-chart discipline, and enforces it with an ESLint rule over React
components. There are no components here, so the rule is asserted on the output:
every element carrying `data-chart` must be a descendant of a `section.view`.
Testing the rendered DOM rather than the template source means it survives a
refactor that moves the templates around, which a source scan would not.

§19.7's other three cases are here too — the caveat strip rendering every
caveat, a suppressed state showing its reason rather than a blank, and low
confidence carrying a class.
