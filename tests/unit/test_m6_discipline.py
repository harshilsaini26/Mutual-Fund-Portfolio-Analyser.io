"""The two rules that keep M6 honest. MODULE_6.md §19.3 and §19.6.

Neither test checks a feature. They check that a property of the code stays
true as it grows, which is the only kind of check that survives contact with a
future contributor who has not read the spec.

**§19.3 — no computation in the view layer.** A number derived in a builder is a
second source of truth that nobody can reconcile against the first, and it will
not appear in any export, audit or reconciliation. §2.1's example of the mistake
is literally `pct = holding.value / total * 100`. The check is a static scan for
division, which is imperfect and catches the common case; §19.3 says so and pairs
it with review discipline.

**§19.6 — descriptive language only.** `PLAN.md` §3.3. The product states what is
true about the data and never what to do about it. Two funds holding the same
company is often deliberate, a concentrated portfolio is sometimes the whole
point, and this product does not know which. The lint runs over every string that
reaches a user.
