"""The coverage tier. MODULE_0.md §6, DECISIONS V1-43.

`tests/fixtures/m0/groww_hdfc_flexi_cap_2026-08-31.html` was built from the
page Groww served for HDFC Flexi Cap Direct Plan Growth on 2026-09-13, 491,655
bytes as fetched. **It is trimmed, and here is exactly how:** the rendered
markup was dropped and the `__NEXT_DATA__` payload kept, minus the keys this
parser never reads (peer comparison, news, fund-manager prose, return series).
All 86 holdings are verbatim, as are `aum`, `nav`, `isin` and `scheme_name`.
Nothing was edited to make a number work — unlike the workbook fixtures, whose
stated totals were adjusted after trimming, this one needed no such edit
because the rows were not trimmed.

**What that fixture cannot prove**, and a test below covers separately: on the
real page the payload begins at byte 250,231, and in the fixture it begins at
byte 344. The first draft of `sniff` looked at a 200 KB prefix and scored 0.00
on the real page while scoring 1.00 on a fixture built from it. A fixture
derived from the artifact under test can agree with a bug, so the offset is
tested against a synthetic page instead.
